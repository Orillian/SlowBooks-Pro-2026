"""An import's error list comes whole, and the page can save it (discussion
#349).

The Transaction Detail by Account and categorized-sheet importers cut their
list at twenty and said "… and 14,070 more", and the person asked whether
there was a way to see the whole report. There was not. Both lists come
whole now, as the IIF import's already did (2.23.4 gate, W-6); the page
counts them and offers Save the list, a text file of every line. The
ledger's are problems to accept or leave out since #663, every one listed.
